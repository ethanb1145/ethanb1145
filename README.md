## 👋 Hi, my name is Ethan Bustamante and here's a bit about me! 👇

### Origin of Tech Interest

    Starting in my early childhood years, my interest for software development all began with a simple thought of working with computers. One day on a "take your child to work day", I was brought into a tall office building; from then on I was infatuated with thoughts of the city and its tall buildings, computers, and also elevators. I was encouraged to keep these interests, and I did indeed fixate on this idea (as you can see to the right here in this 10/10 artwork 👉, p.s the yellow thing is a computer).

### Journey

The high school I went to opened up a new elective class and that was Computer Science. I took this class for a full year and it only solidified my dream to work with computers and brought me into software development and led me into Turing School of Software and Design, a 1500 hour intensive software development program. This program was indeed intense; school hours being from 9am - 4pm MT, projects being assigned weekly, and independent studying to keep up and understand the concepts being taught. This all could only be achieved by dedication, passion, adaptability, and many more skills in order to keep up with the program and its requirements to move forward.
