## üëã Hi, my name is Ethan Bustamante and here's a bit about me! üëá

### üåü Origin of Tech Interest

    Starting in my early childhood years, my interest for <strong>software development</strong> all began with a simple thought of working with computers. One day on a "take your child to work day", I was brought into a tall office building in a business center and spent the day there; from then on I was <em>infatuated</em> with thoughts of the city and its tall buildings and computers (also even <em>elevators</em>). I was encouraged to keep this interest of computer work, and I did <em>indeed </em> fixate on this idea and it turned into a <em>dream</em> (as you can see to the right here in this <strong>10/10</strong> artwork üëâ, p.s the yellow thing is a computer).

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Journey

During my senior year of high school, the school opened up a <strong>Computer Science</strong> elective class. I took this class for a full year and it only solidified my dream to work with computers, brought me into software development, and led me into <strong>Turing School of Software and Design</strong>, a <strong>1500-hour</strong> intensive software development program. 

#### üìö Turing School of Software and Design

Turing School of Software and Design is a federally accredited software development school and after reviewing my options for starting my career in tech, this one in particular stood out to me. Turing is sectioned out into four different sections, Mod 1 to Mod 4, each focusing on different areas of software development, and areas that were relevant to what the industry actually looks like and needs. This school not only offered the technical skills that the industry needed, but also industry practices that would be used in the workplace such as teams doing stand-up meetings, DTRs, and retros. So I enrolled in the Back End program and the reward for completing this program was an Accredited Certificate in Backend Engineering and being one step closer to my goals. This program was indeed intense to say the least; school hours from 9am - 4pm MT, weekly projects, assignments, and independent studying to order to keep up and understand the concepts being taught. This all could only be achieved by dedication, passion, adaptability, and many more skills in order to keep up with the program and its requirements to move forward. 

### üèà Interests and Hobbies üèÄ

I grew up playing sports such as football and basketball so since then I've been pretty into sports; my teams are the Denver Nuggets and the Denver Broncos (when they win...) and I also really enjoy watching UFC, an MMA fighting organization. In my free time I like to play video games such as Overwatch 2 and The Finals but I've truly have been waiting for Cities Skylines 2 to drop (I'm in love with <em>tycoon games</em> üåÜ). Another hobby I have is developing my passion project called <em>CodeCore</em>; during high school what really helped me learn and study were interactive apps like Kahoot and GimKit, and I really love the idea to create a quiz app like these that helps me study in the way of developing it with new technologies I'm learning and also using the app myself to study!
